# TH1172_R2_Submission
Project Title – [SafeRoute]
Team ID : TH1172

1. Overview:
SafeRoute is a design prototype built in Figma that demonstrates how users can find safe, reliable, and accessible routes during large gatherings like the Ujjain Mahakumbh.
The prototype showcases core features, multilingual support (English/Hindi), and a user-friendly interface aimed at improving crowd navigation and safety.

2. Problem & Solution
• Problem Statement:
Commuters often face challenges navigating through unsafe, blocked, or overcrowded routes, which can risk personal safety and cause delays. There is a need for a digital system that provides real-time updates on route conditions, helping pilgrims navigate safely and reducing the risk of accidents and chaos.

• Solution:
SafeRoute provides an interactive navigation system with features such as:
 - Safe route suggestions with clear status indicators: Open, Crowded, Blocked.
 - Multilingual support (English & Hindi) for wider accessibility.
 - Simple dropdown-based route planning for quick use.
 - Easy-to-understand route status legends for clarity.

3. Logic & Workflow
• Data Collection: (Planned) – User inputs starting point and destination via dropdown menus.
• Processing: (Planned) – Backend will process real-time crowd and route safety data (not yet implemented in prototype).
• Output: Figma prototype visually demonstrates safe route suggestions and safety legends.
• User Side:
  Language toggle (English/Hindi).
  Route planning interface.
  Dropdowns for selecting start & destination points.
  Safe Route button → displays suggested path.
  Route legend (Green = Open, Yellow = Crowded, Red = Blocked).
• Admin Side (Future):
  Ability to update crowd and route status data.
  Manage route safety inputs for live event monitoring.

5. Future Scope
 • Convert Figma prototype into a fully functional website.
 • Integrate real-time traffic and crowd density APIs.
 • Enhance multilingual support with more Indian languages.
 • Implement AI-driven route safety predictions.
 • Deploy cross-platform solution for both web and mobile users.
